Collegiate clubs provide practical exposure to a professional engineering society as well as focal point for campus engineering programs and projects. The SAEINDIA Collegiate club started functioning in our college in 2017 with over 80 student members along with two faculty advisors in the department of Mechanical engineering. Since its inception, the students of the collegiate club are actively participating in various activities conducted by SAEINDIA. Last year 5 students were participated in the Tier 3 events of the SAEINDIA student convention held at Chennai. Also, a team of seven students went for Aero Design Challenge competition in which the students have to make their on aeroplane according to the criterion laid down by SAEINDIA. This year, the collegiate club have conducted a Student Knowledge Improvement Program (SKIP) under SAEINDIA Southern Section which was first of its kind conducted inside Kerala.

Cell of VJCET has started functioning formally   since 02.05.2016.    MOUS  were signed with many  industries from different disciplines of Engineering to ensure effective collabration between the industry and the institute in a formal  and syatamatic  manner.  Regular ineratcion with industies  helped in equipping students with the proper skill,  set to become competent industry ready Engineers.  Many activities such as technical talks from industrial experts,  industrial visits,  internships,  training   workshops    etc  were  organized for students regularly at department  level.   The BARC outreach programme organized by IIIC on theme Atomic Energy for Brighter Future” has  attracted  the attention of  students and was well appreciated. An R & D project   costing   rupees 34 lakhs for  developing lead lithium level sensor was  awarded to VJCET  by BRNS and is being completed  successfully.   VJCET management has taken a wise decision to   depute a high level delegation   to visit   research centers & universities abroad   and Hannover Messe.  The   team could visit reputed universities and   research centers   in Europe and  the largest international industrial trade fair in the world.   The experience gained and   exposure obtained to research activities,   modern technologies and manufacturing processes were really   inspiring and encouraging. Creating    opportunities for students and faculty   members to do research, projects, higher studies, internships etc in Germany and other European countries will lead to a paradigm shift to the engineering education at VJCET.  Visiting HANNOVER MESSE was a marvelous engineering experience.   Services   Senoir Experten services    Germany  is being  successfully  utilized for the benefit of institution.
